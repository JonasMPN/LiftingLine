# Rotor wake aerodynamics Lifting line code


### To dos:
- Implement the Bem part to obtain a Ct 
    - copy over 
- build interface to give the Bem stuff to the tool creating the geometry

And further down the line
- implement function to obtain the velocity field resulting from an element
- superimpose fields 
    - look into the matrix stuff

### Code flow
1. Initialize the operating conditions
2. Get $C_T$ from BEM
3. Compute wake structure from the Ct
4.
